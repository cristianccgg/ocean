# Tempest Digital

## Project Overview

This is a React-based web application developed by Christian Gutierrex - CrixiumDigital. The application is built using modern front-end technologies including React 19, Vite, and TailwindCSS.

## Folder Structure

The delivery includes two main folders:

1. **`source-code/`** - Complete source code for the project
2. **`build/`** - Production-ready build (the compiled application)

## Getting Started with the Source Code

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.0.0 or higher recommended)
- npm (v9.0.0 or higher recommended)

### Installation

1. Navigate to the source code directory

   ```bash
   cd source-code
   ```

2. Install the dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start the application in development mode, typically at http://localhost:5173

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Starts the development server
- `npm run build` - Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder
- `npm run preview` - Serves the production build locally for preview

## Deploying the Build Version

The `build/` folder contains a production-ready version of the application. You can deploy this directly to any static web hosting service:

1. Upload all contents of the `build/` folder to your web hosting server
2. Ensure your server is configured to serve a Single Page Application (may require a simple redirect rule)

## Making Changes

### Content Changes

Most text and image content can be found in the source code, typically in the following locations:

- `src/components/` - UI components
- `src/assets/` - Images, icons, and other static assets

### Style Changes

The project uses TailwindCSS for styling:

- Global styles can be found in `src/index.css`
- Component-specific styles are applied using Tailwind classes in the component files

- React 19
- Vite 6
